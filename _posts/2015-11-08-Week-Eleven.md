title: Week Eleven

---

This week we learned how to implement a vector class, the difference between extending and implementing a class, and the difference between using a class vs a struct. I felt like they were pretty useful concepts to learn especially of object oriented programming. 

This week was a really busy week for me as I had 3 projects due. It was difficult for me to balance time between all the projects and ensure I finished them before the due date. As a result my partner and I had to submit Darwin late. We spent a great deal on trying to decide how to design the structure of the classes as we were not allowed to use getters and setters. However, the main reason for not finishing on time was we were stuck on this one bug which took us long time to figure out. The bug was in the hop instruction, pc was not being incremented properly before the empty creature and the creature was being swapped on the board. Even though this was simple bug we had to test out code step by step until we figured out where the bug was. Putting all that aside I did have fun coding this project. 

 
<h1>Tip of the week</h1>

For one of my side projects I was trying find a good way store images to on a database. I found this awesome website called ‘cloudinary’ that allows you store images and it was just made for that. Integrating it with your project is pretty easy regardless of whether is on web or mobile. Here is the URL to the site http://cloudinary.com/
