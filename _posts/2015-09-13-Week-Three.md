This week I learned the value of attending talks provided by the department and how much advice you can get from the people working in the software engineering industry.  I also learned the value of pair programming and how much potential it has to improve my productivity as a programmer.

This week during class a software engineer from Bloomberg, Chris Martin, gave us some insight into what it's like being a software engineer, resume tips, and a little bit of how to tackle interviews. I also make it my goal to attend these types of talks to improve my interviewing skills. I attended “How to Ace Your Technical Interview with MAD and Microsoft”  and a workshop on resume building and career planning with Pinterest earlier this week. Attending all these talks helped me realize the mistakes I have made during my past interviews. I’m really glad Professor Downing takes the time and effort to bring speakers to class to speak about these topics. As a student, oftentimes you don’t know what to expect from an interview, how to handle an interview, how to make your resume attractive to companies, or what companies look for when they are interviewing candidates. Going to talks like these helps to learn about these aspects and find what you lack and what your strengths are. I would definitely encourage my fellow classmates to attend these type of talks. 

Oftentimes programmers work by themselves and fail to see the value of pair programming. Having someone else looking over your shoulder tracking your every keystroke helps to you produce better quality code. As one person codes the other person checks so see if that person’s logic and code is correct. It’s kind of like live unit testing after every statement. Often when you are against a wall, it helps to bounce ideas off your partner to overcome this wall. This goes well with the saying, “two heads are better than one.” Working in teams results in better quality code than what you would have accomplished on your own according to the articles given to us from class reading. The skill of being able to work in teams is valuable to companies, since many times you will be working in teams in the real world. 



<h1>Tip of the week</h1>

Get in the habit of solving one interview question a day. Instead trying to cram a lot of interview questions right before an interview, try spreading it out. It doesn’t matter if you solve a big problem or a small one, just make a daily goal to finish at least one question. Another important habit to have for solving problems is to practice talking to someone while trying to explain to them how you would the problem. This habit will let you be more confident during a technical interview which will boost your confidence and help you excel in your interviews.
