This week we had a speaker from Mutual Mobile and learned how to implement a stack. 

The speakerâ€™s name was Conrad Stoll. I found his talk very insightful regarding creating open source software and its benefits. Releasing a open source project into the community can be very useful not only to people who use the software, but also to the person who made the software. Often times generous programmers will contribute additional features and fix issues to the software. This way the community gives you a helping hand in maintaining the software and to its improvement.

This week I mostly spent on preparing for interviews, doing interviews and trying to finish up Darwin. My partner and I spent a great deal of time trying to decide how to design Darwin and ended up changing it a few times before we finally stuck with one design. At first we did a basic outline of our structure and slowly filled in our functions. We are hoping to finish early. 
 
<h1>Tip of the week</h1>

I found this awesome PDF web tool called Smallpdf. The tool allows you to convert PPT to PDF, excel to PDF, image to PDF, merge different PDFs together, splits PDFs and etc. I have used this site for a number of different occasions and it seems to be very useful. I particularly found the image to PDF and merging different PDFs together very usefull. The URL to the web:  http://smallpdf.com/
