OOP has finally ended, and I am sad to say that this will be my last Downing class before graduation. Overall, I enjoyed this class. The class is little challenging if you don’t have any previous experience with Object oriented programming and C++. As a result you have to spend your own time learning and implementing all the concepts we learn in class. The material we learn in class in definitely worth learning. During my interviews I got asked quite a few OOP questions and I was so glad that I was taking the class. 

There were a total of 5 projects for the whole semester. I probably liked the last two projects the most since we actually got to use our OOP knowledge to use make games. Coding the last two projects really helped me understand the OOP concepts and at the same it was a lot of fun. The two exams we had were not too bad. However they really test you whether you understand and learned the concepts taught in class. 

I love Professor Downing’s teaching style. He doesn't just give you a lecture he makes it interactive where the students try to explain the examples and exercises shown in class. And if you don’t have the correct answer he will help you understand it. This creates a form of active learning instead of just spoon feeding knowledge to the students, which I really appreciate.   


<h1>Tip of the week</h1>

I would definitely command taking this class before you graduate you definitely learn a lot of things. I would recommend having some familiarity with C++ and OOP concepts before taking this class that way you will get more out of this class. This was a great class to take!!!!!
