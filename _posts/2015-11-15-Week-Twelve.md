This week we finally got our last project, Life, and had a talk given by Steve Ronderos from Atlassian. 

Our latest project seems similar to our previous project Darwin. Life is also known as the Game of Life, made by John Conway. The game is a simulation of cellular automation in other words it follows a set of rules that govern the destruction and replication of the cells. This game requires zero players. One key difference would between the two projects that we are learning to use an abstract class this time around. I think this will a fun project to code. 

Unfortunately, I had to miss Fridayâ€™s class where most of the new material was taught as I had final round of interviews with RedHat. RedHat's final round interview process seemed to be a little bit different than what I have experienced before. All the interviewee and the interviewers had dinner together before the actual interviews took place. This was so that each of could get to know each other better. I think as a result at least for me, I wasn't as nervous when I had the interviews with them. Which I thought was a huge benefit for me, as I usually get nervous. Overall it was a great experience and it was a lot fun getting to know about the company and its people.   


<h1>Tip of the week</h1>

I have learned through my interviews how important doing side projects are. I would definitely recommend people to do side projects while they are in school. Not only does it give you more experience it shows that you love programming even when you are not required to program and I think companies think highly of that.
