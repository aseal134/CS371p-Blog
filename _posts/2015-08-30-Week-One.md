As the second week of school comes to an end I take away with learning about our first project the Collatz Conjecture.  

I had the pleasure of coding this project in python when I was taking SWE. Even though the project specs are mostly the same, it certainly had three main differences. Firstly, I have little experience with C++ so I had to learn syntax and the features the language brings. Second, unlike python I had to worry about integers overflowing. Third, you have worry about memory leaks.

Collatz is a great first project. The level of difficulty is not high at all. The project is meant to give everyone a hands on experience with the how the class works and the tools we will be using throughout the whole semester. Tools such as Git, Github, Travis CI, Doxygen, Gcov, Google Test and Valgrind. The way professor Downing has set up the project requirements and specifications achieves that goal. The professor does a great job of explaining in great deal of what to do and what to expect. After finishing the project you take learning about the tools if not a lot but at least a little. 


<h1>Tip of the week</h1>

Learn how to use to Git properly! I have met quite a few programmers who donâ€™t use Git or hasn't even heard about it. Learning how to use version control can save your life as a programmer especially when you working for a company. Speaking from personal experience last year I was making an iOS app. During that process I ended up making this huge bug that would crash my program every two minutes while the app was running. I spent a whole day trying to figure what the bug was. Luckily I remembered taking a snapshot of my working code on Github. I compared the differences with my old version and the current version I had and with ease I was able to identify the problem and solve the issue. Another reason you should use it, is that when you work in teams you can make separate branches in otherwise copies of the same code so that each team member can work on a different part of the software to implement a enhance or feature for the software. After all the work was done they could all merge their work together using Git with ease.
