Realizing that I am graduating soon, I wanted to improve my skills as a programmer before I face the real world. Since I took Software Engineering with him in the past and absolutely loved it, so I decided to take OOP with Professor Downing.

With this week coming to end, I learned about two valuable tools for software engineers. The first is unit tests. Units tests play an important role to produce quality code and preserving the integrity of software. For instance, let’s say you were to develop a bank transaction software, and your code had a bug that added $100 to accounts when account holders withdrew $500 or less, instead of subtracting the withdrawn amount. The bank would not be happy with your software since you didn’t run tests on your software before releasing it. However, had you written unit tests to check your software bugs you could have caught this bug and fixed the problem. Another great thing about unit tests is that you can run them with commands every time you make changes to your software, with ease. This helps you ensure the quality of your code. 

The second is valuable thing I learned in class was why we should document while creating software. For example, recently I worked on an employee management software that needed improvement. As easy as it sounds it was quite a challenging task. The guy who originally wrote  the software left without leaving any sort of documentation. It was really difficult to understand the purpose of some of his database tables and why he did things in a certain way. I spent quite a few days just looking over his code to understand it better. However if he had documented his software and explaining his reasonings for the code. It would have made my life easier. When I started to make the upgraded version of this management software I made sure to document my software. 


<h1>Tip of the week</h1>

Always document your software no matter how big or small the project is. The way you want to document is as if you are trying to write a tutorial for someone. This in turns helps both you and the other people. For instance if you were to hand off this project to someone else he can read this documentation and pick up where you left off with ease. And another good reason is say you are looking back to improving one of your old projects. It would be really helpful to have that documentation. Since at most time it will be the case where you had forgotten all about the code you wrote and why you wrote certains thing.
