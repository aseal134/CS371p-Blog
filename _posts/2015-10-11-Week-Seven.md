title: Week Seven

---

We are on the 7th week of the semester and we finally had our first OOP exam. During class we mostly learned about iterators, const int and const pointers this week.

I spent most of this week studying for the exam. I went over all the examples Professor Downing had done throughout the semester and implemented them from scratch. You can only truly understand code once you implemented it yourself. Since I had two exams on the same day it was definitely hard to balance between the two subjects. OOP proved to be the most time consuming of the two subjects. This was because I had to test my implementation to verify if my solution worked properly. If you paid attention in class and practiced all the material I think you should be well prepared for the exam. I am excited to learn new interesting concepts about C++ and Object Oriented Programming. 

<h1>Tip of the week</h1>

If you looking to learn and do bit of iOS mobile app designing check out this tool called Sketch 3. I haven't used it much, but so far it seems to be an awesome tool to make your own design from scratch. Itâ€™s a good alternative to Photoshop and Illustrator and it costs way less. Here is a link to the tool https://designcode.io/sketch. This tool uses vector format for its images so it allows you to create all the image assets in different resolutions for all the different iPhone sizes. It seems have some tiny bugs as do all software, but I would definitely recommend using it especially if you want to build a app from start to finish.
