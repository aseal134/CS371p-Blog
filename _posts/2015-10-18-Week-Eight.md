This week was an exciting week. We were given our third project of the semester and started to learn how to implement vectors.

Our third project is making a C++ like allocator. It’s not as complicated as the real allocator, but it gives us an idea of the real one works like.  The main idea behind the project is to give space when it is asked for and keep track of free and allocated space. We keep track of the of different types of spaces using sentials. After the allocated space is done being used, we need to make sure merge it with available free space. That basically sums up the project.

Learning how to implement a vector will help us to learn about object oriented design. I don’t think just reading about object oriented is enough. You need to practice on your own to truly understand how to do it and the usefulness behind it.   
I thinking implementing a vector will achieve that task. 

<h1>Tip of the week</h1>

Lately I have been trying to improve my front end designing skills so that I can be a full stack developer. One of the important aspects of front end design is choosing good colors. I been using the Google color guidelines to pick my colors. Here is the link to it https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html#. It’s pretty useful it has all the hex code and different shades of a color so that you can mix and match your colors. I would recommend using this to find colors for whatever you are designing.
